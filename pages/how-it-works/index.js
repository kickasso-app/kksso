              <Paragraph fill>
                We believe studios are a great place to share art, and that
                original art stands outs. We are committed to helping art
                communities thrive.

                A studio visit is a unique opportunity to experience art in the
                making . Whether it's a spacious workshop or an intimate home
                studio, you'll get to see artworks in progress, learn about the
                artist's process and practice, and connect with them personally.

                  We believe that collecting art is an art form in itself. It's
                  about more than just acquiring objects. It's about forging a
                  personal connection with the artist's vision. Each piece
                  becomes a part of the collector's story, reflecting their
                  values, passions, and unique perspective on the world.

                  A for-profit model is the best way to ensure that Arti remains
                  sustainable and can continue to support artists and the art
                  community. We are committed to transparency and fairness. We
                  will always be open about how we operate and how we make
                  money. We tried as much as possible to embody our goals and
                  values directly in the platform's functionalities.
