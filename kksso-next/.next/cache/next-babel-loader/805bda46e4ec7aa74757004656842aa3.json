When the studio is open for a special showing\n              or one-time performance, they may also mark the date with an event\n              tag. The location of the studio would be not public until the\n              artist approves a visit request.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Art lovers and collectors would use the app to search and filter\n              artists’ studios in a specific city, using a specific technique,\n              and/or offering visits during a specific period. When the artist\n              receives the request, they can review the art lover or collector’s\n              profile and when they approve the visit request, both are notified\n              and the visit details are confirmed.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              During the visit, if the artist has some works for sale and the\n              collector is interested in buying it, the transaction can be made\n              using the app and once a photo and the artwork details are quickly\n              filled out, a contract and a certificate of authenticity is\n              automatically delivered to both. Shipping is an optional addition\n              to the contract. The artwork is then marked as sold and is\n              optionally added to the collector’s profile. After the visit, both\n              host and guest may write a review and rate the visit experience.\n              This helps artists and visitors decide on future visits.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"highlighted\">\n              * +++++++ We do not tolerate any kind of sexism, racism and other\n              forms of discrimination ++++++\n            </p> */}\n            <br />\n            <br />\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Grid>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
