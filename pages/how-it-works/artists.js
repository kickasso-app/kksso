                Our definition of a studio is quite flexible. It can be a large
                studio workshop, or a private space in an artist's home, or a
                small exhibition or art community center. The key is that it is
                a place where art is created and shared.

                  We put the artists first. We believe that artists should be
                  able to focus on their work and not worry about marketing and
                  sales. We provide a platform where artists can showcase their
                  work, connect with art lovers, and sell their art. We are

                We believe that curation is an essential part of the art world,

                managers to ensure that the selected studios and events
                represent the local art scene. The curator will be responsible
                for inviting artists and organizing events. If you are

                  blockchain technology where each artwork will have a unique
                  digital signature, and when it is sold a second time, the
                  artist will receive an agreed upon percentage of the sale.

                  To protect Arti's core mission of supporting independent
                  artists and fostering a more accessible art world, we propose
                  a voting system where artists and curators can veto major
                  changes. This system would prevent future schemes and policies
                  that prioritize profit over the community's interests. By
                  giving creators a direct say in Arti's development, we can
                  avoid the pitfalls of other platforms that, after gaining
                  popularity, exploit their users for financial gain. This
