            <h2> Concept</h2>
            <p>
              The main new concept is using studios as complementary to public
              art spaces. From the cultural viewpoint, opening up the studio
              space enables a more intimate experience of art presentation and
              reception and a better chance for sharing and exploring artistic
              practices in the creative environment itself. Financially, the new
              direct interface between artists and collectors leads to an
              opportunity to design a smoother and more profitable art sales
              process for both.

            <p>
              Our founder Ruth Gudrun Wurlitzer comes from inside the
              contemporary art scene. As an architect, she has always been
              friends with the most thrilling contemporary artists and shared
              their art. This is how collecting started &#8211; and later it
              became passion.
              <br />
              Her initial idea when starting Artitious was to pass on some of
              her great experience to the art interested public. After the
              platform became successful within a short time, she continued to
              expand Artitious to a veritable art portal.
              <br />
              Gudrun Wurlitzer is a board member of the Staatliche Akademie der
              Bildenden Künste Karlsruhe.

              Artists would create a hosting profile with a description and
              photos of their artwork and studio space. They would also include
              the times they are available for visits as well as other details
              like the number of guests and any specific studio rules or time
              limits they prefer. When the studio is open for a special showing
              or one-time performance, they may also mark the date with an event
              tag. The location of the studio would be not public until the
              artist approves a visit request.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art lovers and collectors would use the app to search and filter
              artists’ studios in a specific city, using a specific technique,
              and/or offering visits during a specific period. When the artist
              receives the request, they can review the art lover or collector’s
              profile and when they approve the visit request, both are notified
              and the visit details are confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the visit, if the artist has some works for sale and the
              collector is interested in buying it, the transaction can be made
              using the app and once a photo and the artwork details are quickly
              filled out, a contract and a certificate of authenticity is
              automatically delivered to both. Shipping is an optional addition
              to the contract. The artwork is then marked as sold and is
              optionally added to the collector’s profile. After the visit, both
              host and guest may write a review and rate the visit experience.
              This helps artists and visitors decide on future visits.
