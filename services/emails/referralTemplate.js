          The idea started with the understanding that studios are a great place
          to share art and creativity. Studio visits help as well fill the gap
          of having a direct channel between artists and collectors. This way
          artists can show their work how they prefer and host events such as
          workshops. Collectors get to explore the creative process more
          intimately and buy artworks directly from local artists. Find out more
