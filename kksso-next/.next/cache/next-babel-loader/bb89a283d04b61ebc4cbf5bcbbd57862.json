Shipping is an optional addition\n              to the contract. The artwork is then marked as sold and is\n              optionally added to the collector’s profile. After the visit, both\n              host and guest may write a review and rate the visit experience.\n              This helps artists and visitors decide on future visits.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"highlighted\">\n              * +++++++ We do not tolerate any kind of sexism, racism and other\n              forms of discrimination ++++++\n            </p> */}\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n        </Grid>\n      </section>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\nexport default About;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
