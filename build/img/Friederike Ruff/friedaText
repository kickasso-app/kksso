I am a collector. I gather unusual items such as toys, religious fetishes, boxes of torn magazines, stuffed animals, dolls and other ephemera that gain an afterlife in my collages and room installations. I am an incubator of ideas. I engage in research, reflect and seek information about topics spanning from psychology, philosophy, science, poetry, alchemy, history and politics (just to mention a few). I collect memories and travelling is an essential constituent of my artwork. The impressions and experiences gathered throughout my journeys become the starting point of stories that develop on the canvas in often miraculous ways at times. I regard the process of image creation as an elevator to the underworld where I encounter my personal inner world, archived impressions and underground channels to the ancient mythical cosmos of archetypes. I use techniques such as painting, collage, embroidery and installation. In my work I engage with manifestations of the paradox and the linkage of micro and macro cosmos. I am interested in the interconnection and kinship of the individual and the quintessential, the body in a physical and a metaphorical sense.Comings and goings, mortality, eternity and constant change are my main topics. Beside my individual art practice, I also work as a trainer for peacebuilding through creative methods worldwide and engage people from various backgrounds in participatory art projects.

My studio is my brain, my heart, my labotory, my workshop, my library, the home of a collection of different kind of objects I bring from my various journeys. It is the place I work, contemplate and meet people. I am a passionate host and love to share thoughts and insights with others in order to create new connections and meaning. I believe life is a collage and through interconnection we can build up new ideas and opportunities.
